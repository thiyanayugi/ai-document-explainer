# AI Document Explainer - Project Description

## One-Paragraph Description (LinkedIn/GitHub)

**AI Document Explainer** is a production-ready web application that helps international students, expats, and anyone dealing with complex official documents understand what they mean and what actions are required. Built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, it automatically extracts text from PDFs and images (with OCR support for scanned documents), analyzes the content, and provides clear explanations of deadlines, obligations, risks, and next steps in simple English. The app includes an interactive chat interface for follow-up questions, supports German documents, and is fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment. Perfect for portfolio projects demonstrating full-stack AI development, production-grade architecture, and real-world problem-solving.
